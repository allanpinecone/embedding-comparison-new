## Issue: No Results Showing in the UI

If you're seeing zero results in the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

### ✅ Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initialize the System**
   - Click "🔧 Initialize System" in the sidebar
   - Wait for "System initialized!" message

2. **Load Movies Data**
   - Click "📥 Load Movies Data" in the sidebar
   - Wait for "Loaded 3743 movies!" message

3. **Select Models and Dimensions**
   - Choose Model 1 and its dimensions
   - Choose Model 2 and its dimensions
   - You should see model info displayed

4. **Create Indices**
   - Click "🏗️ Create Index 1" button
   - Click "🏗️ Create Index 2" button
   - Wait for "Index created" messages

5. **Upload Movies to Indices**
   - Click "🚀 Upload Movies to Both Indices" button
   - Wait for "✅ Movies uploaded to both indices!" message
   - This step is CRITICAL - without this, searches will return no results

6. **Search and Compare**
   - Enter your query (e.g., "scary movies about ghosts")
   - Click "🔍 Search Model 1" button
   - Click "🔍 Search Model 2" button
   - Click "⚖️ Compare Models" button

### 🚨 Common Issues:

**Issue 1: "Please select Model 1 first"**
- **Solution**: Make sure you've selected both a model and dimensions for Model 1

**Issue 2: "Please select Model 2 first"**
- **Solution**: Make sure you've selected both a model and dimensions for Model 2

**Issue 3: No results after searching**
- **Solution**: Make sure you've uploaded movies to both indices (Step 5)
- Check that the upload completed successfully

**Issue 4: "Index not found" errors**
- **Solution**: Make sure you've created both indices (Step 4)
- Check that index creation completed successfully

### 🔍 Debug Information:

If you're still having issues, check the browser console (F12) for any error messages, or look at the terminal where Streamlit is running for error details.

### 📊 Expected Results:

After following all steps correctly, you should see:
- Model 1 Results with movie titles and similarity scores
- Model 2 Results with movie titles and similarity scores
- Comparison metrics showing overlap percentages
- Performance visualization charts

### 🎯 Quick Test:

Try this exact sequence:
1. Initialize System
2. Load Movies Data
3. Select "all-mpnet-base-v2" with 768D for Model 1
4. Select "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" with 384D for Model 2
5. Create both indices
6. Upload movies to both indices
7. Search with query: "scary movies about ghosts"
8. Compare models

This should give you results showing different movies and similarity scores for each model.
